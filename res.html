                <p>The la-la-land was in my head
                    I guess you blinded me under your spell.
                    The heartbreak is obvious
                    When you want something that’s nothing but hell
                    I wanted a piece of you, to blow away all your deepest scars
                    A text is all I’ll ever need
                    But here I am crawling back to you,
                    
                    You make me lose my sanity, my dignity, myself.
                    I ditched my self-respect, my loyal friends to give you one more chance.
                    It’s like you don’t want me here, but you don’t want me gone, idk what you want.
                    You need to stop pulling the strings cz I’ve lost count of everything I lost!
